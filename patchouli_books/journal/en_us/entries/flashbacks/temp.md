# Cold Nightmare

I'm staring at the flickering flame of the fire in my fireplace. I am sitting in my office chair, working on my computer. I have multiple files open which show schematic plans for an underground bunker. I look down at my phone and see two notifications.

The first is from a press release my PR consultant held about the unveiling of our state-of-the-art cryogenic stasis chamber. It mentions the plans our company has to install thousands of these chambers in bunkers across the world and that these bunkers will open, for those who can afford to enter, next month.

The second notification is a text from my chauffeur, telling me my car is ready. I walk out of my office and take the elevator, descending 80 floors to the entrance of our office building. My chauffeur greets me and I enter the car.

I am taken to a factory, to oversee the production of the raw materials for these chambers. I walk down the factory floor, and witness hundreds of enormous smelteries pouring molten metal into casts. one of the bunkers mentioned in the press release, the same one that I woke up in. I am led to the entrance of the bunker. I am the first inhabitant; the others will arrive soon. I walk down the stairs and into the corridor, and lie in an open cryo-chamber. A technician closes the chamber lid around me, and I start to drift off to sleep.
