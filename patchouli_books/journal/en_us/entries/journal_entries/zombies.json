That eerie quiet followed me everywhere I went. I got back to the bunker, empty handed, before nightfall, and my hunger was ravenous. Night fell and I heard noises near the vault entrance. I walked upstairs and was shocked and horrified by what"

I expect there are more zombies and that they will be back tonight. I'm going to need to be more prepared with protection from their attacks and ways to fight them more effectively."
