I attempted to use the occult magic I learned previously to manipulate aura, and found that it reacts very interestingly to my own blood. It seems that blood carries with it a stronger energy that the air around me, and if put to use, can be incredibly powerful. I should follow where this path leads, I sense that I will learn a lot."
