      "text": "I awoke inside a cryogenic chamber. There were many other chambers around me, and most of them still contained people in hibernation. Perhaps a malfunction in my chamber had awakened me prematurely. I had no memory from before, but I felt that this amnesia was only temporary. I found an empty journal and a pencil in the chamber hallway, so I took it to record any memories that resurfaced."

It seems the entrance was destroyed by a cave in or something worse. After I cleared the blockage and stepped outside, I surveyed the landscape beyond me. I was in a jungle, surrounded by lush and vibrant plants. Curiously, there were no animals anywhere and an eerie silence cloaked everything."
