Perhaps a malfunction in my chamber had awakened me prematurely. I had no memory from before, but I felt that this amnesia was only temporary. I found an empty journal and a pencil in the chamber hallway, so I took it to record any memories that resurfaced."

At the end of it, I saw a large opening where a door should have been. Stepping through the gaping hole, I surveyed the barren landscape beyond me. Everywhere I looked, craters were scattered about as if hit by explosives. In the distance, I could see some greenery but there were no animals anywhere and an eerie silence cloaked everything."
