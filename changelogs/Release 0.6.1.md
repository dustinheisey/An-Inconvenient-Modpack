### Changelog for Release [0.6.1] (2024-08-15)

well lots has changed as usual and I'm not so good at logging everything and had to make a new repository again to fix some git issue but here is some changes. I'm going for a plan to play-test each chapter one at a time with my boyfriend and find bugs then fix them and get ready to test the next chapter. I can't help but make it more epic though as well. here are some but not all of the changes I remember/logged somewhere else

- balance tconstruct armors to not break armor progression
- fix recipes for bucket
- fix staging for all types of plating blocks
- remove hoes before iron tier
- recycle bunker plating blocks in smeltery to get iron
- add brick hopper and fix brick and iron hopper recipe to use terracotta bowls instead of chests
- make elder guardian drop iridescent scales, use that to create aquatic gateway, reward for gateway is heart of the sea and heart of the sea is used to complete chapter 2
- fix not being able to melt malachite
- remove pineapple spawning
- fix permafrost staging so you can break it in chapter 1
- make andesite spawn in more places
- remove dodo birds & mushroom people spawning
- stop tofucraft seeds spawning too early
- change bronze recipe to use immersiveengineering kiln in chapter 1
- change flint and steel recipe to use copper so you can light chapter 1 mechanics that only work with vanilla flint and steel
- modify progression of chapter 1 pottery, changing the way bricks and refractory bricks are made significantly
- modify progression of chapter 2 up to creating a smeltery.
  - recipes are back to using seared bricks
  - seared bricks are made by smelting dry unfired seared bricks
  - dry unfired seared bricks come from drying unfired seared bricks
  - unfired seared bricks come from 2 grout balls
  - grout balls come from mixing together burnt otherstone, water and cement mix
  - cement mix comes from mixing gypsum and clinker in a mortar and pestle
  - gypsum comes from grinding dolostone in a mortar and pestle which can be collected as early as chapter 1
  - clinker comes from cooking kiln feed (block form) in a beehive oven
  - kiln feed comes from grinding limestone together with clay in a mortar and pestle
- fixed the issue with chapter 5.1 feed pellets and wheat being confused in recipes
- removed wheat seeds from more block drop tables
- can craft next tier of armor with the previous tier at any damage instead of only when it is not damaged at all
- reorganized codebase & completely overhauled recipe system across the board
  - means a bunch of bugs could be fixed and a bunch of new ones could be waiting for us but that's fine I'll fix it.
- changed nightmares to flashbacks. I want to make a better way to give a clue as to when you have a flashback because we played chapter 1 and a bunch of patchouli entries flashed by and we never read them. These stories are the point of the modpack so we need to get them to be more visible. this will happen soon
- fix guidebook recipes across the chapters to fit the progression
- added many new items and 2 new blocks
