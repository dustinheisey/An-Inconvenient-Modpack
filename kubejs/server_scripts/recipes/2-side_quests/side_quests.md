# Side Quests

Side quests are all of the features you get access to in a particular chapter that are not directly related to the happy path of that chapter. You basically go through JEI for a particular chapter and pick any interesting things you would like to have in the advancement page. Then you fix the recipes for each of them, then add them to the advancement page for that chapter.

## Still Left to Figure Out

- When to do staging
- Where to put fixing broken recipes for things you don't want in the advancement page
