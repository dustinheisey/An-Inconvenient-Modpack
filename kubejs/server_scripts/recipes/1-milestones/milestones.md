# Milestones

Milestones are the main progression points in your modpack. They are separated by chapter, and each chapter has one or multiple milestones that you need to achieve to move on to the next chapter or milestone. Each milestone is associated with an end eye reward and after completing the milestone the player will have a flashback and can read that story in the journal.

The procedure for setting the recipes for the milestone is sort of scientific and logical. You pick the item you want to be the milestone, based on the story you are trying to tell, and then you work backwards thinking how you could realistically make this item.

After you finish the recipes, you can use the recipe tree as an outline for the happy path in the advancement page.
