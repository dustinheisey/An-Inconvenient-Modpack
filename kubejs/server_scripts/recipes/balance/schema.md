# Schema

Balance recipes are here to clean up the broken things in the recipes after you have added all of the recipes needed to convey your narrative. don't worry about removing recipes while you are creating your happy paths and side quests. after this is finished, come to balance recipes and go through each jei recipe type, and remove any ids that need to go. There should be no added recipes in balancing. There should be no removed recipes outside of balancing.
