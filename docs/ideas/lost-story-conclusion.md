# Lost Story Conclusion

basically i am trying to make the players feel hopeless and like they are cancer. then they go into a dream dimension and somehow listen to/read something that is not a story, its the villagers talking. they are saying that we are living in a dream that it doesn't have to be this way and that we can choose to wake up and dream a better dream and create a better world, or we can choose to stay asleep and let our overlords continue to ravage the world and all of us.

write the dialog path

- easy npc mod
- create a new dimension
- create custom structures or a city or something with a town square
- spawn npc in the city center give them dialogue that you read
- you talk to this person and you can have a choose your own adventure with lots of writing
- then you make the choice i want to wake up or i want to sleep
  - if you choose wake up you are teleported back to the overworld and start age 7.1
  - if you choose to stay asleep you leave the dialogue but stay in the dream world and start age 7.2
