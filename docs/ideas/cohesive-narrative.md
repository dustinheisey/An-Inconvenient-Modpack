# Cohesive Narrative

we need to make the nightmares/flashbacks/dreams tell a singular story in parts instead of joining together a bunch of mismatched stories and making a whole from that

**pattern** - what triggered the memory | climate change | what is next to do

## Overview

- cold eye - hearth | about cryo chamber and bunker | smeltery
- exotic eye - smeltery | about ocean acidification | heart of sea
- guardian eye - heart of sea | about flooding & sea level rise | aura eye
- undead eye - lost ingot | about pandemic | venom sac
- corrupted eye - venom sac | about parasite capitalism | corrupted resonance
- evil eye - corrupted resonance | about funding genocide | cinder dust

## Nightmare Descriptions

- cold nightmare - look at hearth -> go to factory & see smeltery making ingots -> go to cryo chamber and sleep
- exotic nightmare - look at thermometer with high temperature -> hear reports of ocean acidification -> go to fish farm -> talk about scamming customers
- guardian nightmare - at your desk listening to sirens and walk upstairs to the roof -> evacuated because of flooding in a helicopter -> go home and flip channels seeing different natural disasters -> decide to make bunker. look back one last time and talk about bearing witness to the disaster
- undead nightmare - in a meeting with security -> tell them to enforce the no mask policy, no sick leave, workers leaving in droves, opportunity to steal money another way?
- corrupted nightmare - email raising rent for hundreds of people -> walk through a field with homeless tents -> draft email to political leader suggesting to criminalize poverty
- evil nightmare - touring a prison facility that looks more like a factory manufacturing explosive powder -> talking about free labor and criminalizing more things -> talk about the weapons being shipped to x country to fund a genocide -> war machine is money machine
- lost nightmare - setting line of explosive powder and starting a forest fire -> talk about drought and wildfires -> talk about how this is one of the only areas left and is hard to clear with normal methods and that it will be used to grow crops for a special cinder cake that is expensive -> fire catches and starts a chain reaction and makes a much bigger fire than anticipated -> workers die and you are evacuated
- nether nightmare - sitting in your kitchen drinking some nether tea, fly to remote area to oversea oil drilling -> learn of an underground oil chamber -> see the oil and feel ambition -> vision darkens because you are too hot and you pass out from heat exhaustion
