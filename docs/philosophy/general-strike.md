we have the power to tear down capitalism and create a new world. voting will not work. america is a oligarchy. people in power work in the interests of billionaire's. billionaire's exist because we are all conditioned to believe we have to be 2 people to keep surviving, a good worker and a good consumer. if enough people stand together and decide to stop being those 2 people, capitalism falls. I propose a general strike where a substantial proportion of employees just stop going to work, and a substantial number of consumers stop buying things. if the number is high enough capitalism is over. but in order to make this possible we have to create a culture of mutual aid. where people band together and grow food for each other and cook for each other and share housing and help each other and use each other's strengths to benefit the collective. so its not such a big deal if they stop making money because they have somewhere to sleep and food to eat without needing money for it.
