# Streaming

## Objectives

- **Community Engagement**: Involve your audience directly in the modpack development process, making them active participants rather than passive viewers.
- **Transparency**: Provide a behind-the-scenes look at modpack development, building trust and deeper connections with your audience.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Use live streams to identify and address bugs in real-time with the help of live chat, creating a dynamic and interactive development process.

## Streaming Strategy

### Platform Selection

- **Primary Platform**: Stream on Twitch for its strong community of gamers and developers, robust streaming tools, and interactive features like live chat.
- **Secondary Platform**: Stream on YouTube to reach a broader audience and archive streams for later viewing, creating a permanent content library.
- **Additional Option**: Consider streaming directly to your Discord server if you have a following there, allowing for more intimate community engagement.

### Content Focus

#### Modpack Development Walkthroughs

- **Design Process**: Stream your design process, explaining your thoughts and decisions as you develop new features or systems.
- **Real-World Integration**: Demonstrate how you integrate themes like climate change and capitalism into the modpack, providing educational insights and fostering deeper discussions.

#### Bug Fixing Sessions

- **Real-Time Bug Fixing**: Dedicate streams to identifying, reproducing, and fixing bugs with the help of live chat. Encourage viewers to report bugs in real-time.
- **Interactive Problem-Solving**: Discuss possible solutions with viewers and get feedback on the fixes you’re implementing.

#### Interactive Q&A

- **Viewer Interaction**: Host Q&A sessions where viewers can ask questions about the modpack, development process, or broader topics related to modding and game design.
- **Timing**: Schedule these sessions during quieter development periods or less visually engaging tasks to maintain viewer interest.

### Schedule & Consistency

#### Regular Streaming Schedule

- **Consistency**: Establish a regular streaming schedule (e.g., twice a week on specific days and times) to build anticipation and allow your audience to plan to join.
- **Content Rotation**: Alternate between development walkthroughs and bug fixing sessions to keep the content fresh and varied.

#### Pop-up Streams

- **Impromptu Sessions**: Occasionally do pop-up streams when working on exciting features or fixes. Announce these on Discord and social media to draw in viewers on short notice.

### Engagement Tactics

#### Live Chat Interaction

- **Active Engagement**: Regularly interact with viewers in the chat, responding to their comments and suggestions to build a community and keep viewers invested.
- **Polls & Voting**: Use Twitch’s built-in polling features to let viewers influence minor decisions or prioritize certain bug fixes or features.

### Stream Branding & Presentation

#### Stream Layout

- **Layout Design**: Create a simple, clean stream layout that includes your development environment, a prominent chat window, and space for on-screen notes or bug lists.
- **Branding**: Incorporate your modpack’s branding (logo, name, theme) in the stream overlay to reinforce its identity.

#### Stream Titles and Descriptions

- **Descriptive Titles**: Use clear, descriptive titles that reflect the content of each stream (e.g., "Fixing Major Bugs in An Inconvenient Modpack | Live Development" or "Designing New Climate Systems Live").
- **Stream Details**: Update stream descriptions with details about what you’ll be working on, how viewers can participate, and links to your Discord or other platforms.

### Archiving & Re-Using Content

#### Save and Archive Streams

- **Content Library**: Save your streams on Twitch and YouTube to build a library of content that new and existing viewers can access anytime.

#### Clip Highlights

- **Highlights Creation**: Create shorter highlight clips from your streams that showcase significant moments (e.g., solving a complex bug, designing a new feature). Share these on TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube to attract more viewers to future streams.

### Promotion

#### Pre-Stream Announcements

- **Announcements**: Announce upcoming streams on Discord, Mastodon, Twitter, and Reddit to maximize visibility and attendance.

#### Cross-Promotion

- **Platform Integration**: Use your streams to promote other platforms (wiki, social media, mod release platforms), creating a cohesive ecosystem where each part of your content drives interest in the others.
