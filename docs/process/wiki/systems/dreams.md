# Dreams

dreams need to be connected to 3 things: telling the narrative you want to and touching on the themes you want to draw attention to about whatever your modpack is about, foreshadowing about the crafting thing you need to make to unlock the next dream, and something to do with the endrem eyes.

1. Dream comes from creating the hearth. the narrative is going to start to answer the question of why you woke up in the bunker. in this dream you wake up in a factory floor you see lots of smelteries around you they are making stuff for cryogenic chambers you walk to a planning room or something it has display cryo chambers and a map of the bunker on a table. someone is in there and they say a non gendered version of sir/mam, your chauffer is ready to take you to the bunker where you will sleep for 1000 years.
2. Dream comes from creating a smeltery. you dream is about ocean acidification, overfishing, flooding, and a rare fish that will fetch a huge price. its going to lead you to everbright. you are going to everbright to find the fish. (need to make ocean monument spawn only in everbright). you use the heart of the sea gem you get from the fish to create an aura eye. this allows you to sense aura in the air. board meeting discussing the rise in ocean acidification and flooding happening and how it is affecting the amount of fish being caught in nets. the company needs to pivot and catch a fish that is thriving in the new environment because it has a organ that would fetch a huge price. still in a fish farm but you see posters on the wall talking about a rare fish that is only found in a certain place in the world. your farm sells a fish that looks like it and markets it as the real deal.
3. Dream comes from entering everbright.
