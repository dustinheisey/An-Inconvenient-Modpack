# Armor Progression Mechanic

Armor is staged in this modpack. This means that to craft an armor tier (ex. Iron Armor) you need to craft the tiers before it at least once before. Crafting an armor tier unlocks a new recipe for it so that you can make the new tier directly without the previous tiers.
