# Dreams Mechanic

Progressing through the modpack requires you to complete many quests. Certain special quests, marked with a challenge frame in the advancement pages give you end remastered eyes as rewards, along with a dream or a nightmare when you sleep. After you get the eye you can craft another if you loose it.

If you choose to wake up from the dream of a billionaire you can dream your own dreams, good dreams. As you heal the world from all the pain that has been inflicted on her, you will have dreams, and get new end remastered eyes as rewards.
