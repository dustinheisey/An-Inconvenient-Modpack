# Ideas

- documentation about the procedures of developing a modpack
  - find areas of improvements in each of the processes once you are at that level of context

## Procedures

1. Finding the story behind a modpack
2. Split the story into arcs/chapters/ages/stages
3. Split each chapter into 1 - 3 milestones
4. Puzzle out the recipes for each milestone
5. Make custom items/fluids with textures
6. Make advancement pages for each chapter
7. Write stories
8. Cleanup & Balancing
