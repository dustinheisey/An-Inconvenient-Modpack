# Linting Workflow for Minecraft Modpack Project

This document outlines an ideal linting workflow to ensure that the codebase for the Minecraft modpack project adheres to coding standards and best practices. Linting helps catch errors early, enforces code quality, and ensures consistency across the entire codebase.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Tools & Setup

- **ESLint**: Use ESLint to lint JavaScript files, including Node.js scripts and any client-side JavaScript.
- **Prettier**: Integrate Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- **Minecraft-Specific Linting**: Set up linting rules for Minecraft-specific files (such as JSON configurations and scripts).
- **Integration**:
  - Install dependencies: `npm install eslint prettier --save-dev`
  - Create configuration files: `.eslintrc.js`, and `.prettierrc`.

### 2. Linting Rules

- **JavaScript/Node.js**:

  - Enforce best practices such as `no-unused-vars`, `no-console`, and `eqeqeq`.
  - Use the recommended rule sets for ECMAScript and Node.js.
  - Customize specific rules to meet project needs, e.g., enforcing specific coding styles for functions and class usage.

- **Prettier Integration**:

  - Use Prettier as a code formatter to ensure all JavaScript files are formatted consistently.
  - Set Prettier to run after ESLint to handle code formatting issues (`eslint --fix` followed by `prettier --write`).

- **JSON Configuration Files**:
  - Use a JSON linter (like `jsonlint`) to validate Minecraft-specific JSON files, such as mod configurations, advancements, and loot tables.
  - Add validation scripts for key files to prevent syntax errors (`jsonlint config/*.json`).

### 3. Git Hooks Integration

- **Husky & Lint-Staged**:
  - Install Husky and Lint-Staged to run linting automatically before commits.
  - Add pre-commit hooks to ensure that code is linted and formatted before being pushed:
    ```json
    {
      "husky": {
        "hooks": {
          "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
        }
      },
      "lint-staged": {
        "*.js": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
        "*.json": ["jsonlint --quiet"]
      }
    }
    ```

### 4. Continuous Integration

- **GitHub Actions**:

  - Set up GitHub Actions to run the linter for all JavaScript and JSON files on pull requests and merges.
  - Define a `.github/workflows/lint.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    name: Linting Workflow

    on:
      pull_request:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      lint:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout Repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
              node-version: '16'

          - name: Install Dependencies
            run: npm install

          - name: Run ESLint
            run: npx eslint .

          - name: Run Prettier Check
            run: npx prettier --check .

          - name: Run JSON Linting
            run: find . -name "*.json" -exec jsonlint {} \;
    ```

### 5. Minecraft-Specific File Linting

- **Advancements & Loot Tables**:
  - Create custom validation scripts to lint advancements, loot tables, and other game files.
  - Utilize Node.js scripts to parse and validate JSON structures for advancements, ensuring that required fields are filled in correctly.

### 6. Custom Rules for Minecraft

- **Custom ESLint Plugin**:
  - Consider creating custom ESLint rules that enforce Minecraft-specific coding practices.
  - For example, rules that ensure certain configuration properties are always present, or that prevent using deprecated Minecraft methods.

### 7. Automation Recommendations

- **Pre-Publish Checks**: Add a pre-publish script to automatically run all linters before a new release is made.
- **Error Reporting**: Integrate error reporting tools to track linting errors over time and prioritize fixes.
- **Code Review Enforcement**: Ensure that no pull request can be merged without passing linting checks via GitHub branch protection settings.

## Recommendations for Improvements

1. **Automated Fixing**: Make use of the `--fix` flag for linters to automatically correct issues where possible.
2. **Code Style Documentation**: Maintain documentation outlining the specific code style rules being enforced, so new contributors can easily understand the conventions.
3. **Minecraft DataPack Linting**: Investigate existing tools or develop custom scripts for validating Minecraft datapacks.
4. **Consistent Formatting**: Utilize Prettier to ensure consistent formatting across all files, including JSON and JavaScript.
5. **Mod-Specific Linting**: Add scripts that validate configurations for specific mods to ensure proper integration.
6. **IDE Integration**: Configure recommended settings for VSCode or other IDEs used by contributors to provide in-editor linting feedback.
7. **Performance Impact Assessment**: Add linting rules that help identify potential performance issues in the configuration or scripts to optimize gameplay.
8. **Non-JavaScript Files**: Include linting for non-JavaScript files like Markdown (`markdownlint`) and YAML, ensuring that documentation and configuration files are also up to standards.

By following this ideal linting workflow, the Minecraft modpack project can maintain a high standard of code quality, reduce bugs, and ensure consistency throughout development.
